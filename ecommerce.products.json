  "product_description": "<p>The MTX960 is a smart choice for an organization because it offers extra features to expand your communication needs and enhance your operational efficiency. Building on the basic features of the MTX900, the MTX960 has the following additional features.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Audio Technology</strong></p><p>As with any radio, sound quality is critical for effective communications. Motorola’s MTX900 and MTX960 Trunked system radio series can be heard in almost any environment because of LLE and noise-cancelling microphones.</p><p><strong>Wideband and Programmable Channel Spacing (12.5/20/25 kHz)</strong></p><p>The wideband technology and programmable channel spacing of 12.5/20/25 kHz offer flexibility &amp; easy migration should channel spacing requirements expand.</p><p><strong>Automatic Multiple Site Selection (AMSS)</strong></p><p>The AMSS feature extends communications beyond the reach of a single trunked site. In a system where multiple trunking sites are used to extend coverage; the AMSS will automatically switch the radio to a different site when the current site signal becomes too weak. Thus ensuring the user's continuous radio communications.</p><p><strong>Emergency Alarm*</strong></p><p>An emergency function is provided to alert the dispatcher. This function is activated by pushing an easily accessible orange button on the top of the radio. These calls are processed by the trunking system with the highest priority to ensure that they get through as quickly as possible.</p><p><strong>Selective Radio Inhibit</strong></p><p>In situations when the radios have been stolen or are missing, the selective radio inhibit feature will enable the dispatcher to remotely disable the radios for greater security.</p><p><strong>Talkgroup Scan</strong></p><p>Provides effortless scanning combination of talkgroups and conventional channels for messages, and monitoring of channels in a multiple system environment.</p><p><strong>Dual Mode Capability</strong></p><p>Enables user the convenience of selecting either trunked or conventional operation providing maximum systems flexibility.</p><p><strong>Failsoft Operation</strong></p><p>In the event of a trunked system or central controller failure, radio conversation is still possible in fail soft mode. Upon indication of the central controller failure, the radio will automatically revert to a preassigned voice channel and operate in a non-trunked repeater mode.</p><p><strong>Lithium Ion Battery Option</strong></p><p>The Lithium Ion battery option provides high high-capacity battery at a lighter weight; allowing users to communicate for a longer period of time.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>LCD Display</strong></p><p>The 14-character alpha-numeric display contains useful icons and information; such as instant talk group ID, radio signal strength indicator and a battery gauge icon are value-added features to optimize communication efficiency.</p><p><strong>90 Modes</strong></p><p>Allows for up to 90 modes to keep large diverse user talkgroups constantly in touch with each other.</p><p><strong>Intuitive Menus</strong></p><p>Easy-to-use menus and an alpha-numeric phonebook/contact list make the radiosimple and easy to use.</p><p><strong>Unlimited Private Call</strong></p><p>In addition to receiving a one-to-one call, the MTX960 is also able to send one-to-one radio call through the pre-programmed list or via direct entry from the keypad.</p><p><strong>Unlimited Call Alert</strong></p><p>MTX960 will display the caller ID of the latest missed calls from the menu screen via a series of audible signals, ensuring that a page will be received. Users can also send their Call Alert page via a pre-programmed list or direct keypad entry.</p><p><strong>Telephone Interconnect</strong></p><ul><li>Allows the user to receive and make telephone calls through the trunked system, thus expanding their communication coverage. In addition, dialing can also be via the user-editable phone book or direct keypad entry.</li></ul>",
